## Finding 

The correlation between the latitude and the maximum temperature is strong to very strong because the r-value is less than –0.7 for the Northern Hemisphere and greater than 0.7 for the Southern Hemisphere, as shown by the plots here. This means that as we approach the equator, 0° latitude, the temperatures become warmer. And when we are further from the equator the temperatures become cooler. Check the r-values for your plots. 


The correlation between the latitude and percent humidity is very low because the r-value is less than 0.04 for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for the plots shown here. This means that percent humidity is unpredictable due to changing weather patterns that can increase or decrease percent humidity. Check the r-values for your plots. 

The correlation between the latitude and percent cloudiness is very low because the r-value is less than –0.09 for the Northern Hemisphere and less than –0.02 for the Southern Hemisphere for the plots shown here. This means that cloudiness is unpredictable due to changing weather patterns that can increase or decrease percent cloudiness. Check the r-values for your plots.
